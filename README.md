  This dataset originates from Kaggle, titled “Amazon Sales Data”. It includes over 1000 reviews and ratings of products listed on Amazon, with price labels in Indian Rupees. My primary objective is to prepare this data for exploration and present the findings through visualizations. The use of this data is inspired by Amazon's e-commerce system, which places significant emphasis on customer reviews and ratings. This data can be utilized as a concrete basis for data-driven decision-making to enhance customer service, identify product issues, and develop effective marketing strategies.

Fundamental analysis of stocks is a method used to determine the intrinsic value of a stock. This is done by analyzing various economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors that can affect the stock's value. The main goal of fundamental analysis is to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued based on the company's financial condition and future prospects. Some key indicators used in fundamental analysis include : ROA (Return on Assets), ROE (Return on Equity), DA (Debt to Assets),and DE (Debt to Equity)
