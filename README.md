Hello everyone, I'm Rasyid.
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Statistics with a focus on economics and business from Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta. My interest in data began when I decided to pursue a degree in Statistics. I have skills in data analysis, statistical understanding, programming, and data visualization, particularly in the fields of economics and business.
This portfolio is not just a collection of works, but also a documentation of my journey in the world of statistics. Currently, I am seeking professional opportunities in data analysis that align with my skills and knowledge, so I can continue to grow and develop.
Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!
