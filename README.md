# Data Analytics Portfolio - Rasyidhani Aditya Rizky

Hello everyone, I'm Rasyid.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Statistics** with a focus on economics and business from Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta. My interest in data began when I decided to pursue a degree in Statistics. I have skills in **data analysis, statistical understanding, programming, and data visualization, particularly in the fields of economics and business**.
This portfolio is not just a collection of works, but also a documentation of my journey in the world of statistics. Currently, I am seeking professional opportunities in data analysis that align with my skills and knowledge, so I can continue to grow and develop.

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!

  This dataset originates from Kaggle, titled “Amazon Sales Data”. It includes over 1000 reviews and ratings of products listed on Amazon, with price labels in Indian Rupees. My primary objective is to prepare this data for exploration and present the findings through visualizations. The use of this data is inspired by Amazon's e-commerce system, which places significant emphasis on customer reviews and ratings. This data can be utilized as a concrete basis for data-driven decision-making to enhance customer service, identify product issues, and develop effective marketing strategies.
